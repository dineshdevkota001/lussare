# Introduction

Lussare is a way to share lunch money among the participants. No
longer will you have to share the Lunch cost for the dishes you didnt
eat. This app takes care of who ate what and records it. Then, it uses
my proprietary &rdquo; advanced machine algorithm &ldquo; to process
the data, and regurgitates who has to pay how much. you can then
choose to balance out the finances yourself.

## Is the project complete?

As a matter of fact no. But, i dont plan to work on this currently. I had a few features in line. but i doubt i have time to complete those.

For those curious, here was my original plan. Currently i have only completed upto where i think it will be useful:

- [x] Division
- [ ] Balance calculation
- [ ] Name Suggestions
- [ ] Remember Dishes and Users
- [ ] Cloud Sync
- [ ] Integrate with resturant menus and provide a seamless experience

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
